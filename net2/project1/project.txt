1)  Design IP Addressing Scheme   ( the solution can be implemented in various ways)

You have been hired as a consultant by the company  to design / implement IP addressing for their enterprise network.

The company has four locations:- Palo Alto , San Francisco , San Diego and Irvine . At the corporate office in Palo Alto , they have  7 story building. Each floor will be on a separate sub-network.  The branch offices in San Francisco and  San Diego need 2 sub-networks each and the Irvine office needs only 1 sub-network.

The goal is to use the maximum possible machines per subnet and use the same subnet mask.

The IP address to use is â€“ 192.10.10.x

The gateways/router assignments for the clients will be  the 1st available address on each subnet that can be used for a LAN interface.


a)  For each subnet, specify the IP address for the gateway/router

    192.10.10.1
    192.10.10.17
    192.10.10.33
    192.10.10.49
    192.10.10.65
    192.10.10.81
    192.10.10.97
    192.10.10.113
    192.10.10.129
    192.10.10.145
    192.10.10.161
    192.10.10.177

b)  Calculate IP addresses ranges that can be used to assign to hosts/machines on each network.

    192.10.10.2   - 192.10.10.14
    192.10.10.18  - 192.10.10.30
    192.10.10.34  - 192.10.10.46
    192.10.10.50  - 192.10.10.62
    192.10.10.66  - 192.10.10.78
    192.10.10.82  - 192.10.10.94
    192.10.10.98  - 192.10.10.110
    192.10.10.114 - 192.10.10.126
    192.10.10.130 - 192.10.10.142
    192.10.10.146 - 192.10.10.158
    192.10.10.162 - 192.10.10.174
    192.10.10.178 - 192.10.10.190

c)  What will be the subnet mask used for all the machines in this design ?

    255.255.255.240




2) Two users on the network are having problems in communicating. i.e.
User on PCA is not able to communicate with User on PCB. You have been asked to troubleshoot & provide assistance. 

Following is the IP configuration for the 2 machines:


PC: A                   B
IP: 192.20.20.17        192.20.20.150
NM: 255.255.255.240     255.255.255.240
GW: 192.20.20.34        192.20.20.156


a)  What is the problem ?

    A is not in the same subnet as its gateway.


b)  How do you suggest that the problem can be solved ?

    There are a number of ways the problem could be solved. 
    It depends on the nature of the problem. PC A will require
    a reconfiguration, but what to change depends on the actual
    configurations of its hosting subnet.

    1) So long as the netmask and gateway are correct for the physical 
    connection of PC A, its IP should be modified such that its new
    IP is in the following group:
    192.20.20.35 - 192.20.20.46, 192.20.20.33 
   
    2) If the subnet is actually larger (192.20.20.0/26) than the 
    configuration designates, then adjusting the subnet mask could
    resolve the issue.

    3) So long as the netmask is correct, and the IP is correct for PC A's
    network, the gateway should be modified. The gateway's IP will be in
    the range 192.20.20.18 - 1912.20.20.30 if this is the case.
