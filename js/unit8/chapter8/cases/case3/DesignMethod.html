    <h1>Analysis and Design</h1>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
    The analysis phase is where the project's requirements are determined. The resulting requirements document describes what data needs to be stored, accessed, and manipulated. It describes how the user should be able to interact with the system. It determines other services to which it should be tied. The idea is to draw up a working description of what the resulting system will do, without getting tied up in implementation details.
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
    The design phase is where the project's architecture is determined. This determines how the system will meet the requirements, and is therefore driven by the requirements document. For this reason, order is important. The user interface (if any), processes, procedures, algorithms, structures, libraries, etc. are determined in this phase. We determine how the system should look and behave, and what should get it there, before any code gets written.
