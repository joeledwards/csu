1. "new" is a reserved word.

2. This is a problem if "y" has not yet been declared.

3. No output as the only statement which would generate output is commented out.

4. 
char c = 'A'  //assigns a character constant to 'c' 
char c = 65   //casts the integer value 65 to a character before storing to 'c'.

5. 
r3d3 - Valid
_12345 - Valid
California - Valid
U.S.A - Invalid because the . is a separator
$value - Valid

8.
m = 4

9.
  a. float f = 345.6;  //No issue
  b. int a = 35;  //No issue

10. This will not compile correctly because because there is no guarantee that the variable 'n' has been initialized.

11.
  a. zero (0)
  b. one (1)

12.
  a = 44  //The value is truncated to the least significant byte

13.
